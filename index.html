    <h1>My coding journey</h1>
    <h5>By Tanisha</h5>
    <h3>My coding journey starts with one boring day. I was all alone feeling bored. My grandmother, my mom and my brother went out. I didn't know what to do so I messaged my friend saying hi. A few minutes later my friend said hi and said sorry because she didn't my message beacuse there was a class. As I asked what class, she said coding. At such an young age! As soon as she said that my mom came and said to eat my lunch. So I ate while chatting. Mom oversaw my messages and she told me to ask which platform. I asked and she said whitehatjr. My mom talked to my dad and scheduled a trial class. In the trial class, I had so much fun that I asked my mom can I enroll. She said I can and my journey started till now. Right now I am in class 73 and from my experience, YES, coding is fun.</h3>
